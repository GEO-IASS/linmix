linmix Math
============

Linmix is a hierarchical Bayesian model for fitting a straight line to data with errors in both
the x and y directions.

Specifically, the observed independent (x) and dependent (y) variables are assumed to be drawn
from a 2-dimensional Gaussian distribution with mean ($\xi$, $\eta$).

$x, y \sim N_2(\mu, \Sigma)$.
